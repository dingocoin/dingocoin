[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/dingocoin/dingocoin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/dingocoin/dingocoin)

Dingocoin is a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, although it does not use SHA256 as
its proof of work (POW). Taking development cues from Tenebrix and Litecoin,
Dingocoin currently employs a simplified variant of scrypt.

## Development and contributions ‚Äì omg developers
Development is ongoing, and the development team, as well as other volunteers,
can freely work in their own trees and submit pull requests when features or
bug fixes are ready.

#### Version strategy
Version numbers are following ```major.minor.patch``` semantics.

### Branches
There are 4 types of branches in this repository:

- **master:** Unstable, contains the latest code under development.
- **maintenance:** Stable, contains the latest version of previous releases,
  which are still under active maintenance. Format: ```<version>-maint```
- **development:** Unstable, contains new code for upcoming releases. Format: ```<version>-dev```
- **archive:** Stable, immutable branches for old versions that no longer change
  because they are no longer maintained.

***Submit your pull requests against `master`***

*Maintenance branches are exclusively mutable by release. When a release is*
*planned, a development branch will be created and commits from master will*
*be cherry-picked into these by maintainers.*

## Very Much Frequently Asked Questions ‚ùì

### How much dingo can exist? ‚Äì So many puppies! üêï
Mid 2022 (approximately a year and a half after release) there will be
approximately 100,000,000,000 coins.
Each subsequent block will grant 10,000 coins to encourage miners to continue to
secure the network and make up for lost wallets on hard drives/phones/lost
encryption passwords/etc.


### Such mining information ‚õè

Dingocoin uses a simplified variant of the scrypt key derivation function as its
proof of work with a target time of one minute per block and difficulty
readjustment after every block. The block rewards are fixed and halve every
100,000 blocks. Starting with the 600,000th block, a permanent reward of
10,000 Dingocoin per block will be issued.  

Originally, a different payout scheme was envisioned with block rewards being
determined by taking the maximum reward as per the block schedule and applying
the result of a Mersenne Twister pseudo-random number generator to arrive at a
number between 0 and the maximum reward.

This was changed starting with block 5,000, to prevent large pools from gaming
the system and mining only high reward blocks. At the same time, the difficulty
retargeting was also changed from four hours to once per block (every minute),
implementing an algorithm courtesy of the DigiByte Coin development team, to
lessen the impact of sudden increases and decreases of network hashing rate.

**The current block reward schedule:**

1‚Äì4,999: 0‚Äì1,000,000 Dingocoin

5,000‚Äì99,999: 500,000 Dingocoin

100,000‚Äì199,999: 250,000 Dingocoin

## Development tips and tricks

**compiling for debugging**

Run `configure` with the `--enable-debug` option, then `make`. Or run `configure` with
`CXXFLAGS="-g -ggdb -O0"` or whatever debug flags you need.

**debug.log**

If the code is behaving strangely, take a look in the debug.log file in the data directory;
error and debugging messages are written there.

The `-debug=...` command-line option controls debugging; running with just `-debug` will turn
on all categories (and give you a very large debug.log file).

The Qt code routes `qDebug()` output to debug.log under category "qt": run with `-debug=qt`
to see it.

**testnet and regtest modes**

Run with the `-testnet` option to run with "play dingocoins" on the test network, if you
are testing multi-machine code that needs to operate across the internet.

If you are testing something that can run on one machine, run with the `-regtest` option.
In regression test mode, blocks can be created on-demand; see qa/rpc-tests/ for tests
that run in `-regtest` mode.

**DEBUG_LOCKORDER**

Dingocoin Core is a multithreaded application, and deadlocks or other multithreading bugs
can be very difficult to track down. Compiling with `-DDEBUG_LOCKORDER` (`configure
CXXFLAGS="-DDEBUG_LOCKORDER -g"`) inserts run-time checks to keep track of which locks
are held, and adds warnings to the debug.log file if inconsistencies are detected.
